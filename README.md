# WorldLang

## Overview

Worldlang is an application which compiles various online resources to learn different languages. Currently, resources are offered for Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, German, and Spanish. Users can create an account by registering, or log in if they have already registered. From there, they will be able to browse different resources sorted by language. The resources include a description of that resource as well as a link which will open the resource in a new tab.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies needed.
3. Run `npm start` to start the server.
4. Open `localhost:3000/home` in your browser to view the application.
5. Users will be prompted to either log in or register at first. Once an account has been created or logged into, users will be able to see their account information in the Profile tab and different language resources in the tabs on the sidebar.
6. If you would like to log out, navigate to the Profile tab. A log out button should then appear on the sidebar.
7. To end the server, use `Ctrl + C`.

## Future Steps

Due to having a time constraint on this project, there are various features that we were not able to add, but would like to add given the opportunity.

Here are some of them:
- Make the web application responsive.
- Have more resources for each language.
- Add more languages which resources are provided for.
- Give users the ability to bookmark certain resources, and be able to view their bookmarks in the Profile tab.
- Add a goals page in which users can create and update a list of language-learning goals they have.
